# Login Cookie

### About 
This login script provides easy access for static content website. This method is very easy.

### Usage
You can refer to one of my other projects to figure out how to make a login script.

##### Customization
Open the index.js file and edit.  The instructions to edit the file can be found on the index.js file.

### Sitemap
Your login sitemap should look like this, authentication page --> cookie page --> password protected page.  So your website should have 3 pages:

* Authentication Page - With password and/or username login
* Cookie Page - Where a user can pickup the cookie
* Password Protected Page - A page that needs to be authenticated to

###### Warning:
This is not 100% secure but provides easy login that most non-tech people will not be able to figure out.
